### Research Interests

Our lab tackles complex physiological problems by examining how life is organized across scales: cells, tissues, and organisms. We are fascinated by how individual components give rise to collective phenomena and how dynamic behaviors emerge from underlying biological mechanisms.

Our approach is truly interdisciplinary; we iterate between mathematical modeling (including bifurcation theory and stochastic dynamics) and wet-lab experimentation (microfluidics and high-resolution microscopy). By combining ODE, PDE and agent-based modeling frameworks with real-time image analysis, we aim to provide a quantitative understanding of the rules governing life.

### Current Research Projects

* **Biophysics of *T. cruzi*:** Characterizing the relationship between swimming patterns and infectivity through a combination of microfluidic experiments and stochastic modeling.
* **Systems Biology of Metabolic Regulation:** Analyzing the non-linear dynamics of glucose-insulin homeostasis to identify predictive markers for diabetic states.
* **Mechanics of Microsporidia Spore Germination:** Exploring the rapid, high-pressure dynamics of polar filament discharge in microsporidia to uncover the mechanics of cellular invasion.
